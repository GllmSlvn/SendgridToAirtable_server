# Express Server
## _Connecting SendGrid Webhooks to Airtable_


This project is an Express server built with Node.js, designed to manage webhooks sent by SendGrid. The server receives events from SendGrid, processes and filters the data, and updates corresponding records in Airtable. It includes error handling and retry mechanisms to ensure reliable communication.

## Features

- **Webhook Reception**: The server listens for events sent by SendGrid (e.g., `open`, `click`, `deferred`, etc.).
- **Event Filtering**: Only relevant events are sent to Airtable.
- **Airtable Updates**: Data from SendGrid is used to update specific records in an Airtable base.
- **Error Handling**: Automatic retries for updates in case of errors (e.g., Airtable 429 rate limit errors).
- **Security**: Environment variables are used to secure API keys.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Version 14 or higher.
- **npm**: Version 6 or higher.
- **SendGrid API Key**: To receive webhooks.
- **Airtable API Key**: To access and update the Airtable base.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   cd sendgrid-airtable-server
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sendgrid-airtable-server.git
   ```
   
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3. Set up environment variables. Create a .env file in the root directory with the necessary API keys and configuration:
    ```bash
    SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key
    AIRTABLE_API_KEY=your_airtable_api_key
    AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=your_airtable_base_id
    PORT=3000
    ```

4. Start the server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    By default, the server listens on the port defined in the PORT variable (or port 3000 if not specified).
    

## Workflow Example
SendGrid sends a webhook containing an open event.
The server receives the event, parses it, and filters out irrelevant data.
A request is sent to Airtable to update the corresponding record.
If Airtable returns a 429 error, a retry logic is triggered to retry the request after a delay.
